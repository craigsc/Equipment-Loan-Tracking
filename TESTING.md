Testing Plan
============

This document reflects the process by which we will be testing our project.

## Unit Testing

All classes will be unit tested using django and python's built in testing framework. These will be whitebox tests written by the developers and follow django testing conventions.

## Acceptance Testing

We will periodically release a working revision of the project to the client for acceptance/feedback. Pivotal stories will contain instructions to test individual stories.
